Building requires the following packages to be installed on
your machine:
g++, makedepend, flex, bison and xerces-c-3.1.1

To build run 'make' and install the library with 'sudo make install'.

This will create two executables: scrutinizer and testlibrary;
and a dynamic library: 'granska'.
'scrutinizer' is the actual granska program and 'testlibrary' is
a small program that makes use of the library 'granska'.
To run a test to see that testlibrary works, run
'make test'

Before you run the programs you must run the script 'setEnv.sh'. 
run it as: . setEnv.sh 
Note the space after the dot. If not used, the variables will only
be set within the sript setEnv.sh.
